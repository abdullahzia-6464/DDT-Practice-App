          "correct_answer": 0,
          "explanation": "Aquaplaning occurs when driving in wet weather in conditions and a film of water builds up between the road surface and the tyres, which in turn effects the handling of the vehicle. When the vehicle aquaplanes, the steering will seem very ‘loose’. Drivers should stay calm, ease off the accelerator to slow down, but avoid braking if possible. At a slower speed the water will be disoersed and the tyres will regain grip ",
